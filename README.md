# CP Digital Footprints 

A personal, transparent log of my **Competitive Programming (CP) and DSA journey** — tracking daily practice, contests, learnings, and milestones.

This repository exists to document **consistent effort, integrity, and growth over time**.

---

##  Purpose of This Repository

- Maintain a **daily record** of CP contests and DSA practice
- Track **learning outcomes** instead of just ratings
- Reflect on **mistakes, improvements, and achievements**
- Build a verifiable **digital footprint** of problem-solving skills

This is not a solutions dump — it’s a **learning journal**.

---

##  What I Practice

### Core Areas
- Data Structures & Algorithms (DSA)
- Competitive Programming (ICPC-style & Codeforces rounds)
- Problem-solving under time and penalty constraints

### Topics Covered
- Arrays, Strings, Hashing
- Greedy Algorithms
- Mathematics & Number Theory
- Recursion & Backtracking
- Sorting & Searching
- STL mastery (C++)
- Edge-case analysis and optimization

## 🏁 Contests & Milestones

| Date | Contest | Platform | Problems Solved | Notes |
|-----|--------|----------|-----------------|------|
| Dec 2025 | ICPC NERC Finals (Mirror) | Codeforces | 6 | First contest on fresh account |

##  Daily Practice Structure

Each practice or contest entry focuses on:
- What I solved
- What I struggled with
- Key patterns learned
- What to improve next

The goal is **deliberate practice**, not brute force.

---

##  Achievements (Growing)

- Solved 6 problems in an ICPC-style contest
- Maintained disciplined, tool-free contest participation
- Consistent daily DSA practice

(This section will evolve with time.)

##  Progress Philosophy

> **Ratings fluctuate. Skills compound. Integrity lasts.**

This repository reflects:
- Clean problem-solving
- Honest learning
- Long-term consistency over shortcuts
