## Significance of This Contest

This contest was important to me for both **technical and personal reasons**.

- Restarted competitive programming with a **clean and honest approach**
- Demonstrated that **problem-solving skills persist beyond account resets**
- Successfully performed in a **high-difficulty ICPC-style environment**
- Competing against **international teams and experienced contestants**

Solving 6 problems in this format validated my preparation and reinforced my commitment to long-term growth.

## Skills & Concepts Demonstrated

During this contest, I actively applied:

- **Data Structures & Algorithms (DSA) fundamentals**
- **Greedy, Graphs and DP problem-solving techniques**
- **Mathematical reasoning and logic**
- **Efficient STL usage (C++)**
- **Edge-case handling and debugging under time pressure**
- **Time and penalty management under ICPC rules**

## Learnings

- Greedy, Graphs and DP problem solving
- Discipline and integrity matter more than speed
- Careful dry-runs reduce penalty significantly
- Clean implementations outperform rushed submissions
- ICPC-style contests reward consistency over shortcuts

This experience reinforced my decision to build skills **the right way**.

## Next Steps

- Reduce penalty by improving dry-run discipline
- Target **7–8 problems** in upcoming ICPC-style contests
- Continue regular practice with integrity and focus


Implementation under pressure

Solving 6 problems = intermediate → strong CP level
